Since then, UNICEF have expanded their provisions to assist over 58 million children who do not receive education. When developing countries face war, conflict or other humanitarian disasters, UNICEF steps in. They run programs such as early childhood education in Cambodia. This program is based around pre-school education for children living in poor urban communities, targeting those with disabilities. UNICEF’s program is centred around Early Childhood Education (ECE) to develop a child’s mental and physical well-being and enables those children involved with preparation and initiative to go forward to primary education. ECE Cambodia assists with training teachers and parents so they are able to educate children. UNICEF also has built preschool infrastructure in local communities with chairs, desks, chalk / white boards, and sporting equipment. The aim of these facilities is to increase the number of children who attend ECE, which in turn can expand their knowledge and willingness to continue studying through primary and secondary education (UNICEF Australia, 2019).

They provide ideas and plan programs and opportunities depending on the scale and scope of the issue being tackled. Their focus is on saving, improving and nurturing life in areas of the globe that are less fortunate with essentials such as education. Some of the ways Givewell addresses the problem of education is through information-based interventions; this includes involvement in demand. Developing countries require certain items to be able to run programs and some countries struggle with supplying these resources. Therefore, Givewell gives funds and equipment to those in need and facilitates scholarship programs, transportation, clothing and uniforms for school, materials like books, pens, and electronic devices. This increases access to education and enhances learning with technological improvements. Givewell also works alongside governments to monitor progress and management of the system. In many cases, decentralised management systems are put in place to measure student progress, teaching performance and the payroll. For low-income countries Givewell has numerous ways to create a positive effect on education. Givewell aims for children and adults to pursue education until they receive a degree. This will ensure long-term productivity and increase the country's economy with positive linear growth. Evidence of this is shown through Givewell’s help with Ghana. With the removal of enrolment fees into primary and secondary education, there is a much higher increase in people attaining their degree and improved standard of living, compared to when enrolment fees are put in place. Education also reduces the risk of violence and conflict within developing areas with less pressure for young girls to be married or paid off to boost girls and women education (GiveWell, n.d). "

Moreover, the ease and flexibility of obtaining scholarly information is increased with ICT which can ultimately boost students’ academic performance. The AIDS model is a mechanism that is used to promote and increase ICT usage amongst all stakeholders comprising teachers and students. This procedure starts off with Awareness​ towards​ ICT, then the provision of Incentives, ​ following​ Demand​ for​ teachers and lecturers to incorporate ICT into their teaching. After this, Support​ Services will​ be provided for students to learn the ICT. This will ultimately result in an Increase​ in the usage of ICT.

    "In Cambodia, low teacher quality poses as a challenge for this educational model to be successful to its greatest extent. (Donaher,2020) states as of 2015, Cambodian teachers are more highly educated than in the past, but significant gaps remain in qualifications across levels and between urban and rural areas. This elucidates how the model does not address the inequality between urban and rural areas in terms of the teacher's qualifications. Teacher’s qualifications play an important role in the effectiveness of the education being delivered, therefore a teacher that holds a bachelor’s degree would make a greater impact to the educational model than a teacher who does not hold the necessary qualifications. Furthermore, research highlighted that only 2/3 of Cambodian teachers attained a bachelor's degree and this was primarily in urban areas, whereas the teachers in rural areas only completed their education till grade 9. This shows the inequality experienced by students in rural areas as opposed to students in urban areas through the quality of education received. Although the Ministry of Education in Cambodia has identified and addressed this problem through facilitating workshops that assist teachers through training and monitoring. The​ current model, however, has drawn criticism for not providing broader ongoing capacity development and follow-up for teachers (King, 2017). "

To sustain a reliable ICT infrastructure in a developing country like Ghana, investments are prerequisites. However, with the government dedicating most of their budget to other sectors such as health especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in education and ICT infrastructure have declined. With this model being highly reliant on funding, without adequate resources it will not be able to operate to its extent. Furthermore, some buildings within Ghana have not been constructed for installing Wi-Fi devices (Rabah, 2015), due to this limitation the development of an ICT educational model is still a challenge. Another limitation that prevents the problem from being addressed through this model is that current lecturers are still developing their knowledge on how to incorporate ICT within their teaching. Due to the constant advancement of technology, some lecturers do not have adequate skills necessary to operate new technology (Bingimlas, 2009). This elucidates how that although the model does improve educational quality within Ghana it does not address other primary concerns such as providing the right training for the teaching staff to incorporate ICT within the educational system.

Rule Based primarily uses psychology to learn and understand why people follow and choose to go with or against the rules. These rules consist of societal values and beliefs, which differ from person to person. The model will use these rules to create circumstances and analysis to predict how they will behave. Rule Based models can be influenced by a single or multiple agents. Due to these agents, the types of models can either be fixed or adaptive. A fixed Rule Based model has people that follow rules to get to the end result in the quickest and most efficient way possible. On the other hand, an adaptive model shows people taking a different approach where they trial and error to find the most effective way to complete a task. An adaptive Rule Based model usually has one person watching another person, then from personal judgement, they will choose whether to take the same method, adjust to better fit their needs or try a new approach entirely. Many times Rule based models have shown to have complex outcomes. This can be due to external factors out of a computer/simulations control. For this, there is a level of error when using the Rule Based model (41189 Introduction to Human-centred Complex Systems, n.d -a)."

Segregation model is based around searching for a tolerance within two different groups being sampled and tested to see whether or not a critical level of tolerance exists. Tolerance alludes to the idea of both groups staying together and their ability to adapt. Conditions are tried to represent real-world situations. The Segregation model also looks at interactions between the two sample groups for theoretical importance rather than applied (Hatna & Benenson, 2010). This agent-based model is known to be one of the most primitive representations of the science behind residential segregation as it explains how one’s judgement and impressions towards contrast can result in segregating.  In terms of the initial model, particular agents reside on the cells in a rectangular-shaped region however such cells can take up merely one agent. These agents are able to move nearby based on the “fraction of friends”, which are essentially the agents that belong to the same group.  The Segregation model's basic assumption is: “an agent, located in the center of a neighborhood where the fraction of friends f is less than a predefined tolerance threshold F (i.e., f < F), will try to relocate to a neighborhood for which the fraction of friends is at least f (i.e., f ≥ F) (Schelling 1978 p. 148).”"

Each of the squares refers to the other squares around them. This square will then choose whether or not to change what they are doing to match their neighbouring square. If the square choses to do so, then a random feature is changed but if they do not then the algorithm will show that the unchanged square is very different to the other squares, thus no interactions.

Education in developing countries can use a rule based model to create an environment where people study from childhood, instead of starting later. A reputation for communities such as those in Afghanistan and Cambodia could potentially use this kind of model to their advantage. The rule based model is purely based on other people's behaviour and attitude towards a certain issue. Education can benefit greatly when started from a young age as children can adjust easier to the condition and schedules of school, whereas compared to those children who start studying at a later age and miss out crucial aspects of basic learning. A rule based model of a mass majority of children who start school at the age of 5 or 6, will allow for an adaptive, evolutionary, rule-based model.

Culture can influence the reasons for those countries with poorer education standards compared to other countries and this should be acknowledged. With Axelrod’s culture model, we can use coordination games to test a set of traits and ideologies of a group of people or an individual about why they act a certain way. This model can assist with understanding how culture and education coincide and coordinate with each other and perhaps to find out how much this benefits societies in developing countries. When someone is very different from yourself, many people choose to not follow or interact with them. This principle can be applied to the issue around education to collect evidence that culture can differentiate one from studying and one not. "

    "The methodology implemented in the AIDS model in Ghana was a quantitative approach, which means data was collected for statistical studies to present the model. The questionnaire developed consisted of open and closed ended questions without the inclusion of any personal questions. However, despite this the answers gathered from these questions still presented the students’ and teachers’ own beliefs with regards to education and technology, highlighting the validity and reliability of the data collected. The participants considered in the study were taken from Accra Technical University which is a tertiary institution that offers part-time and full-time Higher National Diploma (HND) and Degree programmes (Asabere et al., 2017). Full time students were surveyed as opposed to part time because they make up most of the population and they stay on campus for much of the time. 30 students and 4 lecturers were taken from 3 schools within the university as the sample size. Altogether 90 students and 12 lecturers were surveyed to gather data for the construction of the AIDS model. There was a 90% response rate from students and 70.5% response rate from the lecturers, highlighting they had enough data sources to construct their model. "

    "The NGS reform was heavily influenced by the international school-based management (SBM) movement. The New​ Generation Schools originated in 2011 with the Beacon School Initiative (BSI) pilot project funded by an Australian development agency and implemented by the Cambodian education non-profit Kampuchean Action for Primary Education (KAPE) (Bredenberg, 201​ 8)​ . With the initiation of this pilot project, a lot of data was collected beforehand, this includes the effectiveness of the current education model, the quality of education and teachers as well as school retention rates. All these were taken into consideration to construct the NGS model and improvements were made accordingly. "

    "For the AAE educational model, the evaluation team took a mixed method approach for data collection. Case study sites were divided between “deep” case studies which relied on primary data collection of both quantitative and qualitative methods while “light” case study sites only applied quantitative surveys (Jantzi et al., 2019). A total of 894 people were interviewed either individually or in groups during the initial stages of data collection. This included 675 surveys, 132 interviews with the key stakeholders, 62 provincial level interviews and 45 region (Kabul) based interviews. Overall, all three models used a combination of both qualitative and quantitative methods for their data collection, this proved helpful for the construction of the models.  "
